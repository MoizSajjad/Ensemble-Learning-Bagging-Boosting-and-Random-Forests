# Ensemble-Learning-Bagging-Boosting-and-Random-Forests
This notebook demonstrates ensemble learning for classification using Decision Trees, Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forests. It compares performance through accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and hyperparameter analysis, showing how ensembles boost model effectiveness.
